This example is taken from my private project,
I used the library ***google/apiclient*** to work with **Google Sheets API**

But I ran into the problem that I can't just get the values for the named range from the google table through the standard library, so I wrote my quick solution
Of course, when working with large data, this will not be the best solution, but for my -3-4k rows, it works satisfactorily
